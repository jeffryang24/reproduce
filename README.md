# Reproduce

This repository is only for reproducing issue or bug.

## Rules

Each reproduce project must provides the investigation document. The investigation document contains:

- error/issue description,
- suspect/root cause,
- chronology (step by step to reproduce it until you find the solution to fix the problem if possible),
- environment information (such as OS, software version, and etc.), and
- the responsible author.

These rules only apply after **March 20th, 2019**, so old project before that day is not forced to provide the investigation document.
